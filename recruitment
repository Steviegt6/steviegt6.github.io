   <h1>
   My recruitment post failed!<br>
   What now?
   </h1>
   <br>
   
   <h3>
   Make sure your recruitment post has a lot of detail.
   </h3>
   <br>
   
   <p>
   No one likes a recruitment post that's too short.<br>
   Talk about what your mod has to offer, its goal, and why you need developers.
   </p>
   <br>
   
   <h2>
   Do you have enough progress?
   </h2>
   <br>
   
   <p>
   Your recruitment post won't get in if your mod barely has anything done, especially if it's new.<br>
   Try again later when you have more progress.
   </p>

   <h1>
   "You expect me to do work when I don't have anyone to help?!"
   </h1>
   
   <p>
   Prove you're a capable mod leader.
