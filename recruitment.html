    <h2>
      My recruitment post failed!<br />
      What now?
    </h2>
    <br />
    <h4>Make sure your recruitment post has a lot of detail.</h4>
    <p>
      No one likes a recruitment post that's <strong>too short.</strong><br />
      Talk about what your mod has to <strong>offer</strong>, its
      <strong>goal</strong>, and why you <strong>need</strong> developers.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Do you have enough progress?</h3>
    <p>
      Your recruitment post won't get in if your mod
      <strong>barely has anything done</strong>, especially if it's new.<br />
      Try again later when you have more progress.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>"You expect me to do work when I don't have anyone to help?!"</h4>
    <p>Prove you're a <strong>capable mod leader</strong>.</p>
    <br /><br />
