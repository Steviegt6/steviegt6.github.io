   <h1>Stevie (convicted tomatophile)</h1>
   <br>
   <p>Hey there! I'm <strong>Stevie</strong>. You might know me as <strong>Steviegt6</strong> or <strong>convicted tomatophile</strong>.
      Professional retard, satire anime pfp-user, C# programmer, and game modder. You're probably here for my numerous Terraria mods or 
      other various projects. This website is currently a heavy work-in-progress, unfortunately, so it's lacking in content.

   <h3>Terraria Modding Status</h3>
   <p id="backgroundytlink">Happy and proud to be able to say I've more or less entirely <strong>retired</strong> from Terraria modding. That doesn't mean that
   I have any plans to leave the community or to quit programming. Far from it, honestly. As a final parting gift for the world of mod
   creation, I decided to make a relatively well-programmed mod for <span class="comedicyoutubelink">GitGudWO</span> (because why not, lol).
   <strong>Cataclysm will also continue to receive support due to its popularity. I would appreciate any volunteers to help contribute.</strong></p><br>
   <p>Consider checking out a <a href="recruitment.html">copy of Trivaxy's recruitment page.</a></p>
