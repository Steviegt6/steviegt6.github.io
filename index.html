    <h1>Stevie (convicted tomatophile)</h1>
    <br />
    <p>
      Hey there! I'm <strong>Stevie</strong>. You might know me as
      <strong>Steviegt6</strong> or <strong>convicted tomatophile</strong>.
      Professional retard, satire anime pfp-user, C# programmer, and game
      modder. You're probably here for my numerous Terraria mods or other
      various projects. This website is currently a heavy work-in-progress,
      unfortunately, so it's lacking in content.

    <h3>Terraria Modding Status</h3>
    <p id="backgroundytlink">
      Happy and proud to be able to say I've more or less entirely
      <strong>retired</strong> from Terraria modding. That doesn't mean that I
      have any plans to leave the community or to quit programming. Far from it,
      honestly. <strong>Cataclysm will also continue to receive support due to its popularity.
      I would appreciate any volunteers willing to help contribute.</strong>
