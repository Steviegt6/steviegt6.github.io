    <p>
      I have numerous different projects, many being Terraria related in some
      way, shape, or form, but I do have some other ventures. Nearly everything
      I do is for game modding or something similar.
      <a href="projects/stardew64installer.html">Stardew64Installer</a> is a
      good example of game modding software I've made that wasn't for Terraria
      (and I'm pretty proud of it, too).
      <br />
      For more technical and fun stuff, there's
      <a href="projects/tmlpatcher.html">TML.Patcher</a>, which has spun into
      its own organization with numerous
      <a href="projects/tmlpatcher/subprojects.html">sub-projects</a>.
      <br><br>
      You can find a list of all projects in the "Projects" drop-down menu.
